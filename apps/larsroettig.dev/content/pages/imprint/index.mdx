## DISCLAIMER

## LIABILITY FOR CONTENT:

{' '}
<p>
  According to § 7, para. 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) we, as a service
  provider, are responsible for the content of these pages under general law.
  According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged, however, to monitor
  transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances
  that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
  information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability may be
  assumed only from the date of knowledge of a concrete violation. Upon
  notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.{' '}
</p>
<h2>LIABILITY FOR LINKS:</h2>
<p>
  Our website contains links to external websites of third parties, over which
  we have no control. We, therefore, cannot provide any guarantee regarding such
  external content. The provider or operator of such websites is always
  responsible for the content of the linked sites. The linked sites were checked
  at the time of linking for potential legal violations, and no illegal content
  was identified. However, permanent monitoring of the linked pages is
  unreasonable without any concrete evidence of a violation. Upon notification
  of such violations, we will remove such links immediately.
</p>

{' '}
<h2>COPYRIGHT LAW:</h2>
<p>
  The content and works published on these pages by the service provider are
  subject to German copyright law. The duplication, editing, distribution, and
  any kind of exploitation outside the limits of the copyright law require the
  written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of
  these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. If the content
  was not created by the website operator, the copyrights of third parties are
  observed. In particular, content of third parties is marked as such. If you
  become aware of any copyright infringements, please inform us accordingly.
  Upon notification of violations, we will remove the content immediately.
</p>
<h2>ONLINE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

  The European Commission is providing an online platform for dispute
  resolution. Just check out the link&nbsp;
